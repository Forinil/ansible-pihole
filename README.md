# Pi-Hole

This Ansible role automates the installation of [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net)
on your Ubuntu Jammy (22.04) or Focal (20.04) server.



## Usage

Please feel free to redefine any variable in the `pihole_default` dict, but you
must do so by creating a dict named `pihole` somewhere with higher priority,
such as group vars, host vars, or play vars.

**Note that you only need to specify the part(s) of this dict that you wish to edit.**
For example, to reset the minimally necessary variables, add the following somewhere as per above:
```
pihole:
  setupVars:
    webpassword: "abettermoreprivatepassword"
    dns_servers:
      - "127.0.0.1#5353"
```
To understand how the `pihole` dict is merged with `pihole_default`, see `./merge-defaults.yml`
(it is simple a recursive merge using the `combine()` filter, and works reliably in my experience).

But please note that unless you enable hash merging globally, this approach (with a single dict)
limits you to specifying your `pihole` dict in *one place only*. For example, you must not
set `pihole.ftlconfig.privacylevel` in host vars and `pihole.setupVars.dns_servers` in group vars
(in such a case, only values set in host vars would become part of the finally used `pihole`).
This is annoying, I agree, but globally enabling merging of dicts is considered poor practice as
far as I can understand.

### Set the web-admin password

You must supply your own password to `pihole.setupVars.webpassword`.
Note that this role takes care of the [double-hashing that Pi-Hole requires](https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/blob/master/scripts/pi-hole/php/password.php#L58).

For reference, here is one way to double-hash a password provided from stdin:
```
echo -n somelongandsecretstringofyourown | sha256sum | awk '{printf "%s",$1 }' | sha256sum
```


## How to remotely access the Pi-Hole web-admin

Assuming you can SSH into the Pi-Hole host, just open up an SSH port forward
```
ssh -L 8800:localhost:80 alexandria
```

where we forward a local unprivileged port (e.g., 8800), to port 80 on the Pi-Hole host
(in this `alexandria` is configured in `~/.ssh/config`).

In a browser on your local machine, go to `http://localhost:8800/admin`. VoilÃ¡!

PS. The ssh forward command above can be improved by adding suitable flags.
Right now, it opens a terminal session, which is unnecessary.



## The FTL database can get quite large in a year

By default Pi-Hole saves `/etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.db` for a year, which for a
Raspberry Pi running off of an SD card can become a significant chunk of space.
On my DNS server it's currently >3GB, with `/var/log/` using an additional 2GB.

To restrict the FTL database, set `pihole.ftlconfig.maxdbdays` to a value less
than `365`.

### Unattended install

This role runs the Pi-Hole CLI install script in `unattended` mode.
Instead of configuring Pi-Hole via interactive prompts in the CLI, we create
`setupVars.conf` *before* running the unattended install script.

### Suggestions

#### Sync Gravity across Pi-Hole instances

+ https://github.com/vmstan/gravity-sync
+ https://github.com/vmstan/gravity-sync/wiki

Sounds interesting, except I think I prefer each Pi-Hole to be independent.
Perhaps I will change my mind down the road...


#### Should this role configure DNSMASQ custom config?

Perhaps draw inspiration from [`drew1kun` role](https://github.com/drew1kun/ansible-role-pihole).
