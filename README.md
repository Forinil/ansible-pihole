# Pi-Hole

This Ansible role automates the installation of [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/).


## Setting the web password

Set in `setupVars.conf` using the `WEBPASSWORD` field.
The password is stored in this file in some hashed form. 

[But how exactly, and how can we generate our own hash?](https://github.com/drew-kun/ansible-pihole/blob/0315891ed63e406318c5e33bdcc0443f37e8b396/defaults/main.yml)

Pi-Hole's web password must be stored as a [double SHA256 hash](https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/blob/master/scripts/pi-hole/php/password.php#L58).

To hash a password supplied from stdin:

```
echo -n P@ssw0rd | sha256sum | awk '{printf "%s",$1 }' | sha256sum
```



## How to open the Pi-Hole webadmin UI remotely

Assuming you can ssh into the Pi-Hole host, just open up an SSH port forward

```
ssh -L 8800:localhost:80 alexandria
```

where we forward a local unprivileged port (e.g., 8800), to port 80 on the Pi-Hole host.

In a browser on your local machine, go to `http://localhost:8800/admin`. Voil√°!

PS. The ssh forward command above can be improved by adding suitable flags. 
Right now, it opens a terminal session, which is unnecessary.



## Gravity-Sync(?)

Sounds interesting, except I think I prefer each Pi-Hole to be independent.
Except perhaps for the FM Pi-Hole's...
